Python Scripts for Cyber Security Automation

The goal of this repository is to track my growth in learning how to script in Python, specifically in the area of automating cyber security tasks for work flow efficiency. 

My first project is a real time CVE list generator script that I presented as a project in the University of Texas at Austin's Cyber Security Bootcamp.
